>The services themselves are small and purpose-built, created to help fulfill the necessary business goals of the organization.

>In contrast, it's reare for a company to need to change the underlying implementation of any given product without accompanying business requirement changes. This is why vounded contexts should be built around business requirements and not technological requirements.

>Databases may provide read-only replicas; however, this can expose their inner data models unnecessarily. Batch processes can dump data to a file store to be read by other processes, but this approach can create issues around data consistency and multiple sources of truth.

> Modeling event-driven microservices architectures around business requirements is preferred, though there are tradeoffs with this approach. Code may be replicated a number of times, and many services may use similar data access patterns. 


>This quote, known as Conway’s law, implies that a team will build products according to the communication structures of its organization.

>One of the tenets of event-driven microservices is that core business data should be easy to obtain and usable by any service that requires it.

>An event-streaming data communication structure decouples the productino and ownership of data from the access to it.

>Nearly anything can be communicated as an event, from sinple occurences to complex, stateful records. Events are the data; they are not merely singals indicating data is ready elsewhere or just a means of direct data transfer from one implementation to another. Rather, they act both as data storage and as a means of asynchronous communication between services.

>However, any data that is of interest to any other team or service must be published to the common set of event streams, such that the production and ownership of data becomes fully decoupled.

### Chapter01. Building Event-Driven Microservices 나의 생각

<br/>

- MSA는 좀 더 광의의 객체지향이라는 느낌을 받을 수 있었다. 이전에는 코드단위에서 서로 연관된 걸 묶고 각 객체와의 대화를 통해 객체지향 프로그래밍을 했다면 각 객체들의 묶음인 모듈이 하나의 서비스를 맡고 각각의 서비스들의 대화를 통해 비즈니스 로직을 푸는 것 같았기 때문이다.
- 프로젝트에서 역할분배를 할 때 항상 두번째 사진을 고려하게 되는 것 같다. 하지만 책을 읽으면서 오른쪽 (cross-cutting ownership)으로 분배를 하게되면 자연스럽게 "도메인 로직" 보다는 "기술적인 로직"을 따르게 된다는 것을 알 수 있었다.
- 그렇다고 왼쪽(Sole ownership)이 무조건 좋은 것만은 아니다. 결국 이것도 트레이드 오프 관계.
- 콘웨이 법칙(Conway's law) -> 결국 팀의 의사소통 구조에 따라 결과물이 만들어진다
- 이벤트를 데이터라는 관점으로 봐야한다는 것이 인상깊었다. 단순히 무언가를 트리거하는 것이 아닌 이벤트는 비동기적 의사소통 데이터이다.
